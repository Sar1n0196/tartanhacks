  "summary": "Acme SaaS is a project management platform for early-stage B2B SaaS startups (10-100 employees) who need to ship fast while keeping engineers aligned on customer needs and business impact.\n\nThe company's mission is to help teams ship faster by eliminating context switching and connecting every task to customer outcomes. Their vision is to become the operating system for product development.\n\nKey customer pain points: Engineers don't understand the \"why\" behind their work, context switching slows velocity, and it's hard to keep teams aligned on priorities.\n\nBusiness model: Subscription-based with three tiers ($49-$199/month, plus enterprise). Revenue drivers include new customer acquisition through product-led growth, expansion revenue, and feature adoption driving upgrades. Key metrics: 95% monthly retention, 120% net revenue retention.\n\nEngineering priorities: Build features that solve validated customer pain points, ship features that move revenue metrics, prioritize measurable business impact, and choose simple solutions. Anti-patterns: Don't build without validated pain points, don't over-engineer, don't increase user cognitive load, don't build unmeasurable features.\n\nEngineering KPIs: Feature adoption rate within 30 days, time to customer value, customer satisfaction scores, and revenue impact per sprint."
